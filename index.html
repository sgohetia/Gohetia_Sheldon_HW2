        <p class="lb_text">
          Super Saiyan Blue, also known as Super Saiyan God, is a powerful
          divine transformation and a transcended version of the Super Saiyan
          God form.
        </p>
        <p class="lb_text">
          By undertaking godly ki training with a deity to wield the power of
          Super Saiyan God in one's natural state, a Saiyan may achieve a
          divinity-empowered base form, which allows them to use Super Saiyan
          Blue as the Super Saiyan version of Super Saiyan God and this form
          surpasses its predecessor in power.

          Which strengthens the user's rubbery body. It also allows the user the
          ability to manipulate and transform their environment, similar to a
          Paramecia's awakening. Luffy achieved this ability during his final
          battle with Kaidou on Onigashima.

        <p class="lb_text">
          The awakening of the Gomu Gomu no Mi, formerly known as the Hito Hito
          no Mi, Model: Nika, grants the user's rubber body increased god-like
          strength and freedom, allowing them to fight in any way they please.
          It is for this reason that the user is said to become the "Warrior of
          Liberation" (解放の戦士, Kaihō no Senshi?), bringing joy and freedom
          to those around them, and this fruit's power being described as "the
          most ridiculous power in the world.

          The first known artificial one-eyed ghoul. His unique half ghoul state
          is what later inspires the idea of the Quinx. After joining Anteiku as

          becomes known as Eyepatch.

          After being captured by Aogiri Tree, he underwent a drastic
          personality change and after escaping, formed a group with the goal of
          protecting those precious to him and exterminating individuals
          threatening his place of belonging. His kakuja form's distinct
          appearance earned him the alias Centipede (ムカデ, Mukade).

          a former member of the Survey Corps. He was the main protagonist of
          Attack on Titan. He lived in Shiganshina District with his parents
          until the fall of Wall Maria, where he impotently witnessed his mother
          being eaten by a Titan.[33] This event would lead to Eren's intense
          hatred towards the Titans as he swore to wipe all of them off the face
          of the Earth.

        <p class="lb_text">
          Eren possessed the power of three Titans. From his father, Eren

          Ichigo's Shinigami attire consists of a thicker strap across his
          chest. He has four black vertical lines on his forearms and black,
          tattoo-like bands crossing over his chest, wrists, and ankles. Similar
          bands, but with white ends, lie around his neck as collars.

        <h3 class="lb_heading">Naruto Uzumaki - Six Path Sage Mode</h3>
        <p class="lb_text">
          A powerful fox known as the Nine-Tails attacks Konoha, the hidden leaf
          village in the Land of Fire, one of the Five Great Shinobi Countries
          in the Ninja World. In response, the leader of Konoha and the Fourth
          Hokage, Minato Namikaze, at the cost of his life, seals the fox inside
          the body of his newborn son, Naruto Uzumaki, making him a host of the
          beast.[i] The Third Hokage returns from retirement to become the
          leader of Konoha again. Naruto is often scorned by Konoha's villagers
          for being the host of the Nine-Tails. Due to a decree by the Third
          Hokage forbidding any mention of these events, Naruto learns nothing
          about the Nine-Tails until 12 years later, when Mizuki, a renegade
          ninja, reveals the truth to him. Naruto defeats Mizuki in combat,
          earning the respect of his teacher.
        </p>
        <p class="lb_text">
          Two and a half years later, Naruto returns from his training with
          Jiraiya. The Akatsuki starts kidnapping the hosts of the powerful
          Tailed Beasts. Team 7 and other Leaf ninja fight against them and
          search for their teammate Sasuke. The Akatsuki succeeds in capturing
          and extracting seven of the Tailed Beasts, killing all the hosts
          except Gaara, who is now the Kazekage. Meanwhile, Sasuke betrays
          Orochimaru and faces Itachi to take revenge. After Itachi dies in
          battle, Sasuke learns from the Akatsuki founder Tobi that Itachi had
          been ordered by Konoha's superiors to destroy his clan to prevent a
          coup; he accepted, on the condition that Sasuke would be spared.
          Devastated by this revelation, Sasuke joins the Akatsuki to destroy
          Konoha in revenge. As Konoha ninjas defeat several Akatsuki members,
          the Akatsuki figurehead leader, Nagato, kills Jiraiya and devastates
          Konoha, but Naruto defeats and redeems him, earning the village's
          respect and admiration.
        </p>
        <p class="lb_text">
          When Naruto uses his Nine-Tails Chakra Mode in conjunction with his
          Six Paths Sage Mode, he can push his abilities even further, such as
          being able to levitate, becoming fast enough to catch Kaguya Ōtsutsuki
          off guard and durable enough to take a Chidori unharmed.
